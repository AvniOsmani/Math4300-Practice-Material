# Math4300-Practice-Material

Review material and practice problems for some of the topics that you will cover in math4300. 

The practice problems are not a representation of what the questions on your in class exams and final will look like, these are easy problems to help you master how pointers, classes, etc work in C++ and help you understand how C++ manages memory.

I will try to add more review material and practice problems for more of the topics that you will cover in class.
